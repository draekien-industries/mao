## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

-

- [Phase 01]: Used manual ASAR unpack + ignore function instead of AutoUnpackNativesPlugin (regression #3934)
- [Phase 01]: Used makeDatabaseLive(dbPath) factory function instead of static DatabaseLive constant for runtime path injection

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: The exact combination of @effect/sql-sqlite-node + Electron Forge Vite plugin has limited documented precedent. AutoUnpackNativesPlugin has a known regression (issue #3934). Validate during Phase 1 planning.
- Phase 3: Effect.addFinalizer + Stream.tap + fiber interruption interaction in active IPC sessions has no exact documented example. May need prototype validation during planning.
